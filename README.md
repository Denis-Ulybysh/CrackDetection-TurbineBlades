CrackDetection_May2014_ComparingPairs_of_Blades
===============================================

The crack detection algorithm has been modified in May, 19  2014. Now it is based on comparing couple of blades (B1 and B2, B2 and B3, B3 and B1) between each other at a time. It guarantees that the comparison is done under exactly same wind conditions

The algorithm itself is now based on calculating area under the curve in the sideband frequency interval instead of searching for energy peaks in the sideband interval
